# [TW Tropes](http://tw.emsuwu.com)
A website to list the triggering content in shows, anime, books etc. Currently all the data is stored in one CSV lol. I want to make it so that its stored in an online database and that people can contribute to it through the site.

## Roadmap

- The search feature currently just takes you to a list of all the entries in the CSV table. In the future it will work lol.
- A way to contribute trigger warnings to the site, as well as negative representations.
- An account system so that you have to sign in to contribute
- A way to upvote and downvote trigger warning suggestions. Downvoted trigger warnings will not be visible to members who are not logged in. To members who are logged in they will be shown in red (alternatively, I might make like an eye button in the header to show/hide them as well as the upvote/downvote buttons).
